    <br> What $1,200 of stuff would look like:<br><br> -Rent: $1,100+$98 utilites a month. <br><br> 12 Eggs- $4.07, Gallon of milk-$3.68, Loaf of white bread $2.98, Half gallon of orange juice $3.00, One pound of bacon $6.11, Half gallon of orange juice $6.00 (estimate), 50 Pound bag of rice $20, Top sirloin 3 pounds $18, Personally I would problay buy $30 of random stuff on amazon so add that on to the total and I would by groceries twice a month so total would be about $1,321.84 per month so I would use that money very quickly and unless I had a lot more in the bank, I would be done pretty quick. Thanks Corona.
